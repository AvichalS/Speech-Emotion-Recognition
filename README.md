# Speech-Emotion-Recognition-System
SER comprises audio techniques and deep learning methods in an act to recognize human emotion from speech. This project aims to build a deep learning model for recognizing emotions from speech signals. The model is based on Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture and is trained on a dataset of speech samples with labeled emotions.
